# TikTok Claim vs. Opinion Classification (Google Data Analytics Capstone)

This project is part of the Advanced Data Analytics Certification by Google. It simulates a real-world business case where the goal is to build a machine learning model that classifies user-generated content as either a **claim** or an **opinion** to support TikTok's content moderation team.

## 📌 Problem
Due to the high volume of user content on TikTok, manually identifying misleading claims is inefficient. A model that distinguishes claims from opinions can assist moderators and create a safer, family-friendly environment.

## 🧠 Solution
Using the PACE framework, the project covers:
- Planning a full data project lifecycle
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Regression modeling
- Visual reporting for stakeholders

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `data/`: example dataset
- `notebooks/`: EDA and modeling steps
- `reports/`: project proposal and PACE documentation
- `visuals/`: final visualizations and dashboard previews

## ✅ Tools Used
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau (or similar visualization)
- Google Docs (for documentation)

## 🚀 Outcome
A documented end-to-end data science project demonstrating planning, modeling, and communication skills.
